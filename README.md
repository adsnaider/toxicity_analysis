## About
This project was created at [SB Hacks IV](https://www.sbhacks.com/)
It is a machine learning algorithm to detect the levels of toxicity in online
comments. The idea and the dataset came from [this Kaggle
competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)

## Usage
First you must train the model by running the train.py module. This model was
created using TensorFlow so make sure that TensorFlow is installed.

After train.py finishes its run, you can run the server.py module and navigate
to 'http://localhost:9876/'. From here, you just write a comment in the text box
and click submit to show the results in the chart
